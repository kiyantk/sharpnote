# SharpNote

SharpNote is a modern desktop note-taking application built with Electron and React. It provides a clean and intuitive interface for managing notes, featuring a customizable layout, local file storage, and seamless organization.

## Features
- 📝 Rich note editing with a user-friendly interface
- 📂 Organized note list for quick access with folders
- 💾 Local file storage with `.sharp` and `.sharpbook` file association
- 🚀 Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- 📤 Export & Import – Save or load a single note, all notes or a selection of notes
- 🔒 100% Offline – No cloud storage or data tracking. Your notes stay on your device, giving you full privacy and control

## Installation
### Windows
1. Download the latest `SharpNote-Setup.exe` from the [Releases](https://github.com/kiyantk/sharpnote/releases) page.
2. Run the installer and follow the setup wizard.
3. You can now launch SharpNote from the Start Menu or by opening `SharpNote.exe`.
4. After installation, you can open .sharp and .sharpbook files with SharpNote automatically.

### macOS
1. Download the latest `SharpNote.dmg` file from the Releases page.
2. Open the .dmg and drag SharpNote into your Applications folder.
3. Open SharpNote from Launchpad or Finder.
4. If macOS blocks the app, go to System Settings > Privacy & Security and allow it to run.

### Linux
1. Download the latest .AppImage or .deb (for Debian-based distros) from the Releases page.
2. If using .AppImage:
   - Make it executable: ```chmod +x SharpNote.AppImage```
   - Run it: ```./SharpNote.AppImage```
3. If using .deb:
   - Install it: ```sudo dpkg -i SharpNote.deb```
   - Run SharpNote from the applications menu.

## Why SharpNote?
Many note-taking apps either rely on plain .txt files with limited functionality or lock you into corporate ecosystems like OneNote or Notion. SharpNote is designed to be a modern, feature-rich alternative that remains fully offline — giving you complete privacy, control, and ownership of your notes without being tied to a cloud service.
