# SharpNote

SharpNote is a modern desktop note-taking application built with Electron and React. It provides a clean and intuitive interface for managing notes, featuring a customizable layout, local file storage, and seamless organization.

## Features
- 📝 Rich note editing with a user-friendly interface
- 📂 Organized note list for quick access with folders
- 💾 Local file storage with `.sharp` and `.sharpbook` file association
- 🚀 Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- 📤 Export & Import – Save or load a single note, all notes or a selection of notes
- 🔒 100% Offline – No cloud storage or data tracking. Your notes stay on your device, giving you full privacy and control

## Installation
### Windows
1. Download the latest Windows release from the [Releases](https://github.com/kiyantk/sharpnote/releases) page.

2. Unzip the file by double-clicking it or using the terminal: `unzip sharpnote-[version]-darwin-x64.zip`
3. Move SharpNote.app to your Applications folder: `mv SharpNote.app /Applications/`
4. Open SharpNote from the Applications folder.
5. If macOS blocks the app, go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy and allow it to run by clicking Open Anyway.

## Why SharpNote?
Many note-taking apps either rely on plain .txt files with limited functionality or lock you into corporate ecosystems like OneNote or Notion. SharpNote is designed to be a modern, feature-rich alternative that remains fully offline — giving you complete privacy, control, and ownership of your notes without being tied to a cloud service.
